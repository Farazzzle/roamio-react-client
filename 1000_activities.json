Take a look inside a number of the tombs to admire their decoration. Having been less attractive to grave robbers, these tombs tend to be much better preserved than the royal tombs.\n\nLater, follow your guide to the final stop of the tour, Deir el-Medina, an ancient Egyptian village that was home to the artisans who worked on the tombs in the Valley of the Kings.\n\n At the end of the tour, you will be dropped back off at your hotel or selected location",

You will see a large variety of wildlife including sea turtles. You will also get full use of our paddleboards and swim pad.\nPalominos is the second island we will be visiting. The El Conquistador resort controls a small section of this Island and you will not have direct access to it. You will however get to enjoy the live music being played there. This area also has beautiful beaches and crystal-clear water. I also see sea turtles more frequently in this area. It's a great was to spend 6 hours and you are going to love it.",

People come away from our tours feeling they were guests not clients and that is just what Johnny wants. You see the trees where the oil has been coming from for over a thousand years; you see a mill from 1606 where you see the fascinating process of making oil in the old days and then you visit one of Spain's greatest oil producers so as to see how he makes oil and then learn how to taste the different oils and then, finally, be amazed to taste how each oil, just like wine, pairs beautifully with delicious different ingredients. All of this is washed down with excellent local wine.",

Lemosho offers panoramic vistas on various sides of the mountain. Older information on the internet might state that the Lemosho Route is little used. That has not been the case for the past few years, it is now a popular itinerary. Because of the length of the route, the 8 days version is preferred, but if you do not have 8 days to commit to a Kilimanjaro trek the 7 days version is quite acceptable. \n\nThe route approaches Mount Kilimanjaro from the west, beginning with a long drive from Moshi to Londorossi Gate. From there, the first two days are spent trekking through the rainforest to Shira Ridge. The Lemosho route crosses the entire Shira Plateau from west to east in a pleasant, relatively flat hike. Crowds are low until the route joins the Machame route near Lava Tower.",

One of the most important figures in the history of Antwerp is Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640), the famous master painter that brought the baroque renaissance style from Italy to Belgium.

The central idea behind this tour are the five churches that connects the life and work of Rubens. It symbolizes the Rubens walk of fame.

The park is home to the world's densest concentration of black rhinos (more than 50), though even the park's strong antipoaching measures couldn't prevent poachers from killing one of the rhinos in August 2013 and then again in January 2014. They were the first such attacks in six years, and reflect the current sky-high Asian black-market price for rhino horn.\n\nLions and hyenas are also commonly sighted within the park; rangers at the entrance usually have updates on lion movements. You\u2019ll need a bit of patience and a lot of luck to spot the park\u2019s resident cheetahs and leopards. Other regularly spotted species include gazelles, warthogs, zebras, giraffes, ostriches and buffaloes.\n\nThe park\u2019s wetland areas sustain approximately 400 bird species, which is more than in the whole of the UK.",

The same grand pyramids and temples of worship that are still partly standing around.\nYou will discover this fascinating place in a private car that will pick you up from your hotel and with a bilingual guide from Lima, who will translate what the authorized guides in Caral will explan during the tour.\nThen you will visit Bandurria Bandurria an early coastal fishing settlement featuring the first evidence of a ceremonial stone architecture.",

We will visit the logging town of Arlington and drive through the Suak Suiattle Indian Tribe Reservation near the old town of Darrington.",

Although chilly in Winter and hot and humid in Summer, Brisbane is graced with flowering vegetation all year round. From purple Jacarandas in Spring, red Poincianas in Summer, orange grevilleas in Autumn, and yellow wattles in Winter, there is always a floral and sensory delight at any time of the year. This tour visits some of Brisbane's most iconic parklands and gardens, but also provides a fantastic snapshot of the beautiful architecture of Colonial, Heritage and traditional 'Queenslander' homes. The tour will provide you with a comprehensive overview of Brisbane's prettiest places, while always staying close to the majestic Brisbane River.",

You would understand why.\n\nWe will get acquainted with and talk about the famous attractions of Palm Beach including the Flagler's mansion built as his wedding gift for his bride in 1902. At that time the magnificent estate was proclaimed as \"more wonderful than any palace in Europe. . . \" It might have been as exaggeration, but the 75 rooms palace is really breathtaking.\nWe will visit hotel \"The Breakers\" which has hosted such people as Queen Elizabeth, several US Presidents and Hollywood elites, finishing at the present home of former President Trump - \"Mar-a-Lago\".\n\nI hope that this would be one of the highlights of your vacation.",

This is wild ice skating! \n\nJoin us for a fun and relaxing time ice skating on some of our favorite local \"wild ice\" lakes in the Anchorage area, topped off with hot chocolate, coffee or tea and a fireside picnic! This is the perfect activity for both local and visiting families, couples, or individual travelers to experience the local flavor of Alaska's biggest city and have fun ice skating in a winter wonderland. \n\nOur helpful guides will teach guests to ice skate as well as give tips to more experienced skaters, teach wild ice skating + wilderness safety skills, and give an eco-tour presentation on the local flora and fauna while we enjoy a fireside picnic. \n\nMeet you on the ice!",

This trip lets you visit Luang Prabang in an all exclusive vintage jeep!\n\nFirst visits off the day are Wat Aham & Wat Visoun, the oldest temples in the city. That Mak Mo (shaped like a watermelon) was built in 1504 and restored by Henri Mouhot (famous for his restoration work in Angkor). The old part of the city sits on a Peninsula between the Mekong and Nam Khan rivers and it\ncontains many old temples. \n\nWat Xieng Thong is certainly one of the most beautiful and sits at the northern end of the peninsula. \n\nAs you pass from temple to temple, you have the chance to see the local people going about their daily lives.\n\nIn the afternoon, you continue to explore the city's narrow streets with their mix of colonial style houses and green spaces dominated by palm trees and at the end of the afternoon you'll have the option to climb to the top of Mount Phousi for the unmissable sunset.",

This perfectly preserved village has been nicknamed \"Capital of the Middle Ages\" because it still has intact all its defensive structures made of walls and towers that culminate in an austere but spectacular fortress.\nBut Gradara is also a place linked to a romantic and famous tragedy, the one of Paolo and Francesca, mentioned by the great poet Dante Alighieri in the Divine Comedy.\n\nAmong all the guided tours of Gradara that we offer, this is the most complete one that will take you to discover every corner of the village. The activity takes place in groups that can include a maximum of 10 people who, after discovering the most important corners of the village, will give you access to the main floor of the Fortress located on the top of the hill, followed by a walk on the patrol walkways, a true vantage point from Gradara's certainly unique perspective on all the surrounding valleys.",

This place of wonder is situated on the north coast of KwaZulu Natal and stretches from the small village of St Lucia in the South to the border of Mozambique in the North.\n\nThe area is enormous and offers incredible biodiversity. The South (St Lucia) offers a good base from where to explore as one may encounter Hippos wandering the streets at night in the residential area to the odd Leopard that frequents the area as well. St Lucia is truly a wildlife paradise with numerous species found both within and bordering the town. This is a tour never to be missed",

From there, we take the train to a former Ghost Station underneith the border and explore the Berlin Wall Memorial. Some of the best preserved remnants of the Wall can be found here and some of the most spectacular escape stories happened here as well. Where were the most famous escape tunnels? What happened to the buildings in the No Man's Land? And why was this the site of the first victims of the Wall?\n\nAfterwards we head to a more remote area of the former border and learn how East and West developed along the Wall. How could someone build a treehouse in the Death Strip? Why are there still squats along the border? And what does a petting zoo have to do with the Wall? We'll even see a forgotten WW2 ruin, before finishing in an African-Jamaican beach bar, which opened in the former Death Strip - just around the corner from the East Side Gallery.",

You'll see the famous Plac Bohater\u00f3w Getta (Ghetto Heroes' Square), where Jews were selected and taken to concentration camps, also you'll see a fragment of the original Ghetto wall , which now serves as a monument and place of pilgrimage for many Jews. There are houses where thousands of displaced Jews used to live, and the pharmacy \"Under the Eagle\".It's always very interesting to walk these streets and learn their history from a to z",

It is very amazing to see travelers in the water at night when it glows. If travelers choose to swim, once you get out of the water you will see your swimsuit and body light up as you move around.\n\nThe water is not very deep, only about 3 or 4 feet and life jackets are available for those who need them.\n\nThis is a private customizable trip which also gives you the choice to stop for food at your own expenses (Scotchies).",

            "description": "There's a big different between hiring a transportation company offering a ride to distilleries, and hiring a private tour guide, planner and driver that ensures guests learn and see as much as they possibly want to about Kentucky Bourbon Whiskey. \nMost companies selling \"Bourbon Tours\" are selling a ride to and from distilleries, where the tours occur. That's enough for many visitors, but there's so much more to see, learn and taste.\nMy guests learn all about Bourbon and Kentucky before we ever set foot in a distillery. My tour happens along the way.\nYou'll be escorted by someone who knows each and every site we visit; someone who knows the best routes and scenic back roads; and have that many distillery workers can't discuss.\nSmall groups are preferred so that we can have a relaxed conversation about distilling in Kentucky, rather than teacher-student interaction. But I sometimes accept larger groups who want to learn and see more than a typical \"tour\" offers.",

We will pick you up from the hotel and drop you back at your hotel also. Just relax and let us help you discover these most amazing areas of Paris.\n\nLe Marais is the epicenter of the city's gay community, with chic boutiques and vibrant nightlife options outnumbering traditional Jewish establishments. Le Marais is also known for its delectable falafel (especially at L'As du Fallafel), shopping and numerous art galleries and museums.\nand Due to its unique location at the highest natural point in Paris, Montmartre is harder to access than most of the rest of the city. As such, in 1900, a funicular, the Funiculaire de Montmartre, was installed in the city.\n\nFemininity, creativity, daring... Crazy Horse Paris is the most iconic of all the Parisian cabarets!",

Lopevi Island is the closest active volcano to Vanuatu\u2019s capital, Port Vila. Lopevi Volcano is one of the most scenically spectacular islands in the archipelago. As an almost perfect conical shaped volcanic island, it casts an impressive and commanding presence, jutting clear out of the water to a height of almost 5,000 feet. Lopevi Volcano forms the tallest peak in central Vanuatu. Lopevi\u2019s explosive activity has increased in recent times with lava flows sometimes reaching the ocean. Evidence of old eruptions can be seen as scars cutting through Lopevi\u2019s emerald forested slopes.",

This tour goes far beyond the scope of what visitors to the National Park can usually expect. Not only will we view the volcano, but we will ride along the mountain ridges and experience all of the stunning views.\n\nFrom the volcano, we will ride to the volcanic lagoon, \"Laguna de Apoyo\" for an afternoon of relaxation. Swimming and kayaking are offered at the lagoon. There is also a beachfront restaurant with smoothies, food, and cocktails. We will spend the night in peaceful accommodation and head back to San Juan del Sur the following day.",

            "description": "Plashow is a Nazi concentration camp in the southern suburbs of Krakow, founded by the Nazis shortly after the German invasion of Poland. Originally, Plashow, opened in 1940, was planned as a forced labor camp, but in 1941 the camp was expanded and subsequently converted into a concentration camp, where from October 28, 1942, deportation of Jews from the Krakow ghetto began. \nPlashow was known as a concentration camp, supplying several military factories and a quarry with labor. \nThe camp and life in it are shown in the Schindler's List movie (1993) about the life of Oskar Schindler. The area which held the camp now consists of sparsely wooded hills and fields, with one large memorial to all the victims, erected in 1964 and few smaller. As the Plaszow area is now a nature preserve, so the director Steven Spielberg built a camp replica in the Liban Quarry, some hundred meters away. We will visit all this points during our tour.",

We\u2019ll start with the signature Cape Verdean stew, cachupa. Packed with hominy, studded with Portuguese chorizo and topped with an egg, the version we\u2019ll try is prepared by the self-proclaimed \u201cKing of Cachupa\u201d himself. We\u2019ll have coffee from Angola and chocolate from Sao Tome, learning about these commodities roots in slavery and their current move toward free-trade standards. We\u2019ll visit a shop selling religious icons from Brazil and learn about how African religious traditions were disguised within Catholicism for centuries by colonial subjects of the Portuguese crown.",

They have left a darkness here, expressed with stories from the earliest days of our written history to modern times.\n\nStarting with early disasters, we will tell ghost stories we have collected, from fiery deaths to those in the waters of nearby river; from self-inflicted to deaths brought by the state or a rich man\u2019s guilt.

After all, \"Fast is Fun\".\n\nWe pride ourselves on sailing 99% of the time, making this an eco-friendly and sustainable tour, through harnessing the power of the wind.\n\nThis 5-hour excursion is specially tailored for Cruise Ship passengers who are visiting Sint Maarten for the day.",

Every hundred years or so, the hot springs migrate from one spot to another and always leave behind calcium carbonate. You could hike up the travertine terraces. Sometimes elk hang out in the village unafraid of people.\n\nLamar Valley could have been carved out by glaciers thousands of years ago. Now what is left behind is boulders that must have also been moved by glaciers. You will see them strewn around before you get to Lamar Valley proper. The soil in Lamar is suitable for lush grass that you will see. And that attracts bison, pronghorn, elk. But it also attracts wolves and Grizzlies that want to have the other animals previously mentioned for meal.\n\nBesides these two attractions, you will also see Tower Falls as well as Calcite Springs which oozes with super hot sulfuric oil.

It is the largest freshwater lagoon system in Hue. \nA French-era hill station, Bach Ma national park reaches a peak of 1450m at Bach Ma mountain. The cool climate attracted the French, who built over a hundred villas here during the colonial period in the early 1930s. A mountainous area not far from the coast, Bach Ma not only has atmospheric jungle and interesting flora & fauna but also spectacular views over the beautiful coastal beaches and Tam Giang \u2013Cau Hai lagoon. Furthermore, Bach Ma is not on the popular tourist route so you are likely to enjoy this natural wonder away from the crowds.\nThis adventure/ecological tour will take you to the most unique and beautiful landscapes around Hue city, Central Vietnam.",

            "description": "Off the beaten track and out of the hard camps, come and live a unique experience.\n\nThe best way to appreciate the beauty of the Wadi Rum desert. A desert that was millions of years ago submerged by the sea. A desert where poetry ricochets between the cliffs like the sound of stones or sand rising up.\n\nThe Bedouin tradition, which persists in this desert from century to century, is inscribed through nomadic life. This tour will allow you to immerse yourself in the history of these canyons and hidden trails with a local guide.\n\nYou will discover why Wadi Rum is divided into two deserts, what are the so-called mushroom rocks, what is the meaning of the Petroglyphs engraved by the Nabateans who had already started to tame this desert 13 centuries before us.\n\nFar away from all of the non natural light, the cave experience is the best way to enjoy the colors of the sun set and sun rise. From our caves we will be able to see a sky full of stars and the milky way.\n\n\u0627\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0648\u0633\u0647\u0644\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u0648\u0627\u062f\u064a \u0631\u0645",

Part of the flight will also take place at a lower altitude, which will give you the feeling of being on a magic carpet.\nOn the program + 3 hours of service: Pick up in front of your place of residence; Reception and safety briefing; Flight (45 to 60 min); Landing and return to flight base; Traditional Berber breakfast; Delivery of baptismal certificates; Departure for your place of residence\n\nSee you very soon in the air!",

There, we can take a short walk to the highest part and take advantage of the view of the salt flat in 360 \u00b0. Also, we can see from very close the large cactus that adorn this calcareous rock formation.\nAfter this experience, we will have our lunch and we will settle to see the sunset in the salar, a true spectacle of nature.

Sigiriya Rock Fortress is located on a flat surface of a gigantic gneiss rock that towers dramatically. Its vertical walls rises up forming a kingdom of Kassapa where now only the ruins of an ancient civilisation exist. In addition, in order to get there, if you are brave enough, you will have to climb a series of staircases that are attached to rock walls.Once you enter the fort, you will get to witness the ruins, frescoes and water gardens around the premises and the sight of the magnificent rolling hills and forest from the fort will simply baffle you.\nThe beautiful Royal Rock Temple complex sits about 160m above the road in the southern part of Dambulla. Five separate caves contain about 150 absolutely stunning Buddha statues and paintings,some of Sri Lanka&'s most important and evocative religious art. Buddha images were first created here over 2000 years ago.",
